## How It's Made

**Tech used:** React, React-Icons, Material-UI, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, JSX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project was made using React, React-Icons, Material-UI, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, JSX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The frontend was made using React and Material-UI. The backend was made using Express and NodeJS. The database was made using MongoDB.

It was started as a learning exercise, but I have plans to continue working on it. I would like to add a profile page for users to edit their information and add friends, and send messages.

## Optimizations

There is a routing bug where it won't let you signin, it keeps showing the posts. I'm working on fixing that.

I'm working on adding profile screens where users can set more information about themselves, add friends, and send messages.

Long term goal is adding a map view to show where users are located.

Google Authentication coming soon.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about how to structure the back end for a full stack application. I learned how to use MongoDB and Mongoose to create a database. I learned how to use React Router to create a multi-page application. I learned how to use Material-UI to style the application.

I also learned how to structure the front end to communicate with the back end, especially for searching posts. I learned how to use React Hooks to manage state. I learned how to use React Icons to add icons to the application.
